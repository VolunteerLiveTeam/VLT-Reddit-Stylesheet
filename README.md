# VLT Reddit Stylesheet [![Travis branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/VolunteerLiveTeam/VLT-Reddit-Stylesheet/dev.svg?style=flat-square)]

This repository has the stylesheet for [/r/VolunteerLiveTeam](https://reddit.com/r/VolunteerLiveTeam).

The stylesheet itself is a customized version of the [Naut theme](https://reddit.com/r/Naut/).

## How It Works

All the source CSS is in the [sass](https://github.com/VolunteerLiveTeam/VLT-Reddit-Stylesheet/tree/dev/sass) folder. Upon a commit to the `dev` branch, Travis CI will build the CSS and apply it to [/r/VolunteerTestTeam](https://reddit.com/r/VolunteerTestTeam). Upon a pull request to `master`, Travis will build the pull request to [/r/VolunteerPublishTeam](https://reddit.com/r/VolunteerPublishTeam) as a final test. Then, when the PR is merged, Travis will build and apply it to [/r/VolunteerLiveTeam](https://reddit.com/r/VolunteerLiveTeam).
